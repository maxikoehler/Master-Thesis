## Voltage stability
Stability can be decreased by 
1. Load characteristics:
	1. drawn power is getting bigger with less voltage (negative coefficient)
	2. Q of the load is too big
	3. P transmission of the line is not sufficient
	4. ...
2. Generator characteristics:
	1. not enough Q to deliver to the grid
	2. 
3. Transmission characteristics:

## Stability assessment implementation
1. Implement **voltage stability** indices
2. Implement **transient stability** indices (such as CCT)
