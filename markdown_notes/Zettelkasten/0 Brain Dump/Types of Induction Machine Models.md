Induction machines can be modeled either
- static (with characteristic P and Q),
- dynamic with fixed-speed or variable speed, or
- doubly-fed.
The least one requires the most effort and is only suitable for single-machine infinite-bus analysis of the machine itself.
The first model is suitable for a large penetration perception, and is similar modeled to [[ZIP-load models]].
Second one is suitable for network analysis, but with consideration of machine dynamics.

The model is similar to the [[Model of a Synchronous Machine]].

-> Does it make sense to model the Static one AND the Dynamic 'fixed-speed' one?
