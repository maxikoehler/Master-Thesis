1. **Symmetrical grid calculation:**
   - no LV grid
   - only one representative model (symmetrical components -> positive sequence)
   - easier simulation
2. **Static model (existing), capacitive coupled model (most likely only for EMT models), or inductive model (scope):**
   - model and equations of [[Transformers]] depending on this
   - static is existing and can be used as well (simplification for less computational power)...
   - are lightning strikes in the interest of simulation? If yes, a capacitive coupled model could be interesting...
3. **Types of [[Transformers]]:**
   - grid coupling transformers, due to often used OLTCs?
   - PCC transformers: For virtual power plants, wind / solar parks, HVDC / MVDC ([[Harmonic Stability of Converters]])
   - where as well? -> only 2-3 types (or [[Case Studies]])
4. **Considered [[Stability mechanisms]] and assessments:**
   - only [[Voltage Stability Indices]] voltage stability: due to complexity?
   - Retroactive effects on generators: [[Transient Stability of Generators]], due to fast and bigger voltage variation at PCC (Real power more fluctuating)
