### Case Studies
Idea here maybe for better comparison: If one has a critical scenario, all busses will become more critical, but are all busses are getting more critical EQUALLY or is there a problem bus? Can the FSM prohibit / improve this behavior?
1. **Voltage Stability Limits**
	- Can the different transformer tap changer control algorithm exceed the limits of voltage stability or approach the boarder closer as the standard OLTC?
	- How does the Continuous Controller compare, considering similar time constants?
2. **Influence on Machines**
3. **Comparison Standard FSM - vs - Operation Oriented Control Logic**
	- Using the OLTC within its benefits and utilize not only the maximum extended bandwith of the FSM, but the maximum damping moment as well
	  -> What would one consider as damping moment? 
	  -> Does this damping moment have a significant influence?
	  -> Can this control scheme ensure optimal, pre-determent tap position of FSM and OLTC?
	  -> First step towards Operational Oriented Control and towards WAMPC (Wide Area Monitoring Protection and Control)
4. **Change of Load Flow** -> Like model I currently have...
	- Analyze and discuss the SMIB example with load
	- Observation: Load flow direction is changing, therefore control algorithm of OLTC is not sufficient enough. -> PF same result...
	- OR: Automatic Detection of the Switching direction
