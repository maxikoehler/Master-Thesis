Different voltage stability indices, classification, or assessment methods seem confusing and perplex. Important to note here: Every method as its own restrictions and operational behavior backgrounds. The method to choose from is dependent on 
1. **What one want to look at** (such as transient states, static, dynamic, long-term, short-term), and
2. **What target purpose is relevant** (such as margin enhancement, weak area/bus identifications, power management, optimal placement of distributed generation, reactive power dispatch, etc.), 

so that one method os more applicable or useful.
## Time appearance

### Short term

### Long term
## Magnitude of the deflection
### Small signal
### Large Singnal
## Static vs. Dynamic
**Static:**
> Can be solved just with algebraic equations. Convergence of the load flow analysis, and therefore the left-over power margin.

- identify critical loading conditions at given system conditions
- determination of how far away is the current operation point from the critical loading

**Dynamic:**
> Must be solved with algebraic AND differential equations.
