Wikipedia entry: [Bifurcation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifurcation_theory)

Closely connected to bifurcations is the [Chaos Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory) (Wikipedia Entry). Summary by [Edward Lorenz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton_Lorenz):
> Chaos: When the present determines the future but the approximate present does not approximately determine the future.

## General information
> **Bifurcation theory** is the mathematical study of changes in the qualitative or topological structure of a given family of curves, such as the integral curves of a family of vector fields, and the solutions of a family of differential equations.

Further interesting:
- Commonly applied to dynamical systems (such as the power system)
- Change in parameter values (typ. $\mu_\mathrm{n}$) leading to a sudden qualitative change in system behavior or topology
- Occurring in continuous (represented by ordinary, partial, or delay differential equations) and discrete systems (represented by maps)

## (Possible) Usage for Power System Voltage Control
In power system operation and voltage stability assessment, the bifurcation point is the saddle point in the P-V curves of power systems. At this given point only small differences in the initial conditions can lead to very different following behavior of the system. (after Rueda-Torres et al. 2024, Danish 2015)

This bifurcation point is typically the beginning of in-stable behavior and therefore in-stable control of the power system.
Writing down the idea here.
