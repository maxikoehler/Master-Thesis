## Open points / Updates / Questions
- [ ] Looking at the hv / lv dependency in the simulation?
	- [ ] Defining what is the hv and what the lv bus
	- [ ] Defining the connection busses
	- [ ] Does step-up / step-down make an influence? Or if the lower numbered bus is the load inflow?
	- [ ] Simulation and verification with PowerFactory

- [ ] Current Doing: 
	- [ ] Modeling ZIP load
	- [ ] Theoretical for Admittance Matrix 
		    - hv or lv side dependency
		    - vector group angle
		    - switching direction
	- [ ] Look at some kind of index -> First at post-simulation / theoretical; afterwards online and practical

- [ ] Problems: 
	- [ ] Switching direction not always the same -> Why and when which direction necessary?
	- [ ] Load modeling over current injections problematic / generally ZIP problematic
## Next planned steps
1. Integrate an index for voltage stability -> Time in Relation to research questions
	-> Z-Load, OLTC and FSM kind of working and verified
	-> ZIP-Load etc. nice to have, but at the moment a lot of debugging and / or trouble-shooting
2. Theoretical calculation / assessment of voltage stability
	-> combining with parameterized characterization in the simulation and indices
	-> **RATING TOOL**
3. Set-up alternative idea for operational control
4. Set up case studies -> evaluate control algorithms with systematic rating tool
## Results
- Following steps okay

## Following ToDo
- [ ] Modeling: Tap ratio and Angle 
      - theoretical writing down
      - testing out in Python (both directions Machowski and Ilya)
- [ ] Index for Voltage Stability 
- [ ] Theoretical calculation / assessment -> Build up **RATING TOOL**
