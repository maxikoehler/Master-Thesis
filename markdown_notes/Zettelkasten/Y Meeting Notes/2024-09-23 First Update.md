- -> Kick-off presentation and timeline necessary
### Questions:
- How does transformer regulation / voltage control normally work? Which is the governing value (OS, US part of the transformer?, grid voltage, load side of the transformer?, secondary side?)
	- Depends on the interested value and control strategy; sometimes it seems useful controlling the voltage of a high voltage line, sometimes it is not relevant and the more load-orientated low- (or medium-) voltage grids and nodes are mandatory
- Is the FSM capable of varying the power angle? -> not only control of the voltage by different transformer ratio, but as well through "compensation" of needed reactive power possible (more complex control)?
	- No, it is a thyristor based circuit with different current states, allowing a step rage of $\in[-4;4]$ . Phase rotation is part of another EES project, but another circuit/module/part
