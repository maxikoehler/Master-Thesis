### Modeling of Induction Machines
the indurai differences, Firstly, as there is no field winding in the induction motor, the cage rolor is me impeday to cols in quadrature (as for the damaer winding in the yach ronous machine) is model a mature is modelled in the normal way by a deal. a th the startature coil. Secondly, as the induction motor does not rotate at synchronous speed, both the stator armature coils and as the o rotor coils are transformed into a reference frame that rotates at synchronous speed. This the two rat the two rotor equations now include a rotational emf term proportional to the rotor slip speed $s\omega_\mathrm{s}$, and are of the form
$$\begin{align}
v_\mathrm{dR}&=0=R_\mathrm{R}i_\mathrm{dR}+\dot{\Psi}_\mathrm{dR}+s\omega_\mathrm{s}\Psi_\mathrm{dR} \\
v_\mathrm{qR}&=0=R_\mathrm{R}i_\mathrm{qR}+\dot{\Psi}_\mathrm{qR}+s\omega_\mathrm{s}\Psi_\mathrm{qR} 
\end{align}$$
where the suffix 'R' signifies rotor quantities and the slip $s = (\omega_\mathrm{s} - \omega)/\omega_\mathrm{s}$.

The two rotational voltages are proportional to the rotor slip speed and to the flux linkage of the other rotor coil. During a disturbance the flux linkages $\Psi_\mathrm{qR}$ and $\Psi_\mathrm{dR}$ cannot change instantanously and, just as in Equations (11.54) and (11.60), can be equated to d- and q-axis armature emfs $E_\mathrm{q}'$. If Equation (11.170) is further compared with (11.51) the rotational voltages $s\omega_\mathrm{s}\Psi_\mathrm{qR}$ and $s\omega_\mathrm{s}\Psi_\mathrm{dR}$ can be seen to play a similar role as the excitation voltage $E_\mathrm{f}$ and will therefore appear in the corresponding flux decay equations.

The third important difference is that positive current is now defined for motoring action, requiring a sign change in the appropriate equations.

With these points in mind Figure 11.31 shows how the induction motor can be modeled by a transient emf E behind a transient impedance X in the same way as in the fourth-order model of the synchronous generator (Section 11.1.6). However, as the reactance is unaffected by rotor position, and the model is in the synchronously rotating reference frame, the necessary equations are more conveniently expressed in the network (a, b) coordinates (Arrillaga and Arnold, 1990) as

with the change in the emfs $E'$ and $E$ given by
$$
$$
where s = (us - w)s is the rotor slip, X' = Xs + X, XR/(X, + XR) is the transient reactance

and is equal to the blocked-rotor (short-circuit) reactance, X = Xs + X, is the motor no-load

(open-circuit) reactance and Tó = (XR + X,) (wRR) is the transient open-circuit time constant.

The other reactances take the meaning explained in the induction motor's steady-state equivalent
