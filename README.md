## Title and task definition

> _Modelling of tranformers with on-load tap-changers (OLTC) in Pythons_

Fast-switching modules controled transformers respectively their on-load tap-changers, enable a more flexible voltage stabilization. But on the other hand, stability assessments and control strategies are not known. Because of the missing possibility of modelling such a fast-switching module in most grid simulations, using an own python-based simulation tool can be beneficial. An improved ability for analysis and optimization in Python is supporting this approach. Therefore this master thesis is expanding an existing Python simulation framework diffpssi from Georg Kordowich with an alternative transformer modelling, including continouos regulated OLTCs, looking into its control, and testing scenarios on system stability. Follwing key packages are derived from this approach:

1. How can one determine voltage stability/instability?
2. Installation of the transformer + OLTC control in the RMS-Python tool; definition of critical scenarios
3. Adding transformer controls (discrete vs continuous)
4. Simulations for validation and comparison (vs PowerFactory; continous vs discrete)

Additionally:

5.  Installation of the FSM-OLTC controller and test
6.  Determination of small signal stability?
