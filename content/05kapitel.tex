\section{Transformer Model and Validation}

\commenting{
    One key missing model / aspect, especially for short term voltage stability in combination with stability support of the FSM: \textbf{INDUCTION MOTORS}.

    This thesis i sonly presenting a control circuit for standard OLTCs, and their extensional FSM. 
    Line Drop Compensations are not included, WAMPAC methods are excluded, parallel transformer realizations (N-1 criteria; redundancies), are not considered.
    For recent developments, \textcite{sarimuthu_2016} is presenting a review paper considering a few of these topics.

Some conclusion.

\sidenote{Research Questions}
\textbf{1. How do different control types and characteristics of Tap Changing transformers influence the voltage stability of the given system?}

Some summary about Research Question 1. \lipsum[1]

\sidenote{Additional Questions}
\textbf{2. Can the already existing Tap Changer Control of the \acf{FSM} be improved towards a more operation oriented control?}
