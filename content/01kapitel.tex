\section{Research Interests}
\label{sec:research-interests}

Here are gaps and possible extension of knowledge.

Here are the research objectives and questions.

\commenting{
    \begin{itemize}[nosep]
        \item Influence of OLTC control on possible operational uses: Short-term voltage stability, long-term voltage stability; 
        \item Can a increased dynamic regulation help machine recovery?
        \item Does the increased tap ratio gradient harm transient stability of machines?
        Does it help or harm CCT of machines or machine groups?
        \item Transformers act as big low-pass filters: Can this behavior be beneficial as well for the interactions of inverters in the grid on AC side (in the sense of Harmonic Stability)? \quelle
    \end{itemize}
}

\begin{tcolorbox}[float, colback=ees_blue!5!white,colframe=ees_blue, toptitle=1mm, bottomtitle=1mm, left=2mm, right=2.5mm, top=2mm, bottom=2mm, title={\textbf{Research Question of this Thesis}}]
    How do different control types and characteristics of Tap Changing transformers influence the voltage stability of the given system?
\end{tcolorbox}

\sidenote{Influence of FSM on Voltage Stability}
Therefore following questions/steps can be imagined as supportive:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How can Voltage stability of a system be classified and be looked at? Which indices, measurements, etc.
    \item Which transformer model has to be considered to show influences?
    \item Which systems are useful to consider in showing effects? Which circumstances lead to a stability support, which to a decrease? Where can limits be drawn?
\end{enumerate}

Additionally during the process of the thesis, the following question came up as an extension.
Is is the second interest of this thesis, and shall be more focused in the later part.
Therefore some assessments in the \autoref{chap:case-study} are conducted.

\begin{tcolorbox}[float, colback=ees_green!5!white,colframe=ees_green, toptitle=1mm, bottomtitle=1mm, left=2mm, right=2.5mm, top=2mm, bottom=2mm, title={\textbf{Additional Question of this Thesis}}]
    Can the already existing Tap Changer Control of the \acf{FSM} be improved towards a more operation oriented control?
\end{tcolorbox}

\sidenote{FSM Control Advancement? Operational Oriantation}
This question has following thoughs, concerning the different characteristics and dynamics of the \acs{FSM}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How do the different time constants of \acs{OLTC} and \acs{FSM} influence different stybility aspects in the system?
    \item Can the \acs{FSM} be used as a \glqq damping element\grqq~in the system?
    \item Does this possible different behavior of the \acs{FSM} lead to different operating strategy?
    \item What are thoughts on realizing such a strategy with different approaches on the \acs{FSM} controller?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Readers Guide}

The afore stated research interests in combination with the yet not sufficient framework to use make demands on the structure of this work. 
Therefore it seems not sufficient trying to apply a completely standard sequence of chapter like \glqq Introduction - Fundamentals - Methods - Results - Discussion\grqq.
Instead, the following structure is chosen to fulfill the research interests and to give a clear and understandable overview of the work.
This leads to the following structure for the thesis: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\hyperref[chap:fundamentals]{Chapter 2: Fundamentals},}\\
    is illustrating and recalling fundamentals for modeling, stability assessments, and discussions;
    \item \textbf{\hyperref[chap:methodical-modeling]{Chapter 3: Methodical Modeling},}\\
    describes the process of modeling in the tool \textit{diffpssi}, and the implementation of voltage stability indices;
    \item \textbf{\hyperref[chap:verification]{Chapter 4: Verification Setup and Result},}\\
    is showing the verification of the implemented models and tools with the help of common and simple test systems;
    \item \textbf{\hyperref[chap:case-study]{Chapter 5: Case Study},}\\
    is looking at the novel control methods from different perspectives and applications; 
    \item \textbf{\hyperref[chap:discussion]{Chapter 6: Discussion},}\\
    discusses the FSM control strategies, considering the fundamentals, verification, and case study results;
    \item \textbf{\hyperref[chap:summary]{Chapter 7: Summary},}\\
    is summarizing with regards to the research questions, and looking towards research potential and future developments. 
\end{itemize}

When reading this thesis, one might consider its motivation and its prior knowledge for allocating attention to the different chapters.
For someone interested in the strategic development of the \acs{FSM} or \acsp{OLTC} in general, the introduction with its research interests (\autoref{sec:research-interests}) are most important. 
Combined with the Summary and Outlook (\autoref{chap:summary}), the containts of the thesis, answers to the research questions and some perspectives are included.
For this level basic knowledge in power system stability and the electrical energy grid is sufficient.
When one is also interested in the explanations and thoughts why the answers to the research questions are as they are, the chapter \autoref{chap:discussion} is additionally recommended. Eventaully, the chapter \autoref{chap:fundamentals} is giving a few basics for an eased understanding of discussion itself.
The third level would be a demonstration of practical applications in the case studies (\autoref{chap:case-study}).
Lastly, if one wants to further improve or develop the tool {\itshape diffpssi} or the control strategies in particular, the chapters \autoref{chap:methodical-modeling} and \autoref{chap:verification} are recommended.
Additionally the referenced literature and the \autoref{app:power-system-modeling} are giving valuable insights and information.

Following chapter shall introduce the basics for implementing an \acs{OLTC} equipped transformer into a existing \acs{PSS} framework.
This is considering the already existing surrounding, more detailed the electric behavior of the transformer itself and some control engineering theory for the corrosponding \acs{OLTC}. 
Thus its main goal is increasing voltage stability \autocite{machowski_2020}, main indices and assessment methods are considered as well.

\section{Voltage Stability Basics}
\label{sec:voltage-stability}

% \subsection{Voltage Stability Definitions, Classifications, and Conditions}
A Practical introduction to voltage stability assessment, methods and indices is given in the standard and extending literature of \textcite{danish_2015,cutsem_1998}. Further, some useful definitions about voltage sagging and practices are mentioned by \textcite{shoup_2004}, some other best practices, current standards, and development potential is presented by \textcite{rueda-torres_2024}.

\commenting{
    Interesting to note / implement here: Basic classification, definitions, and the nature or conditions of voltage stability. Such as
    \begin{itemize}[nosep]
        \item Short term vs. long term
        \item Static vs. dynamic
        \item Transmission driven vs. load driven vs. generation driven; stability/instability, and/or contributions 
        \item Load vs. transmission aspects
        \item \textbf{Influence OLTC:} Restoring voltage level, but not adding reactive capacities; hence adding risk of voltage collapses
        \item Example mechanism: \textbf{Collapse effect of the nordic test system} \autocite{vancutsem_2020,cutsem_1998}
    \end{itemize}

        \item FRT curves
        \item And the overall possibilities / goals: Increase time until collapse or problematic behavior: Other units, FACTS, generators, inverters, controllable shunts, load shedding, can begin to act, has more time etc. to impact the system and its voltage stability
        \item The lomgitudinal OLTC can't be really "supporting" in voltage support -> no change in $\tan \phi$ possible; phase shifting transformers could adress this problem

An important comment has to be added towards the dynamic behaviors and the connected analysis strategy towards this.
This thesis aims to partly enlighten the dynamic influence of \acs{OLTC} control strategies on the dynamic beahavior of the, or resp. one power system.
According to many standard literautes, is is quite complicated to simplified state or predict stable or unstable operation of a power system in terms of voltage behavior \autocite{machowski_2020}.
Simply the complex interaction between different units, their control schemes and characteristics, and at least the characteristics of protectional devices, are too many influences.
As this thesis is only considering a few aspects of the previous mentioned, only a relative comparison can be targeted.
The use of one stability index for this analysis or predictions is highly unlikely.
Therefore mixtures of possible illustrations, analysis techniques or similar are combined, enabling a discussion about the thesis scope, transformers and their tap changer control schemes.  
        
\subsection{Analytical Stability Calculation of Simple Static Power Systems}
\label{sec:analytical-voltage-stability}

When looking at a simple power system, consistent of a load and a source, analytically deriving the behavior of voltage over power is in its simplest form.
The resulting curves show how the system behaves in (quasi-) stationary scenarios.
Following a system like \autoref{fig:v-stability-system} is used. 
All follwing equations and analysis methods can be re read in standard literatur like \textcite{machowski_2020}, \textcite{kundur_2022}, or \autocite{cutsem_1998}. 

\begin{figure}[htbp!]

    % \missingfigure{Simple system from standard literature}

    \caption[Simplest Load - Source system for deriving voltage - power behaviors]{Simplest Load - Source system for deriving voltage - power behaviors; own illustration after \autocite{machowski_2020,kundur_2022,milano_2010}}
    \label{fig:v-stability-system}
\end{figure}

When looking at the load flow equations, the transferable power over the system from bus one to bus two can be represented by
\begin{align}
    S&=P + jQ = \underline{V} \cdot \underline{I}^* \notag \\[12pt]
    &=\underline{V} \cdot \frac{\underline{E}^* - \underline{V}^*}{-jX} \notag \\[6pt]
    &=\frac{j}{X} (EV \cos \phi + jEV \sin \phi -V^2). \notag
\end{align}
These equations can be split up into the transferable real power in \autoref{eq:func-p-transfer} and the transferable reactive power in \autoref{eq:func-q-transfer}, which might be more common in knowledge and use.
\begin{align}
    P&=-\frac{EV}{X} \cdot \sin \phi \label{eq:func-p-transfer} \\[6pt]
    Q&=-\frac{V^2}{X} + \frac{EV}{X} \cdot \cos \phi \label{eq:func-q-transfer}
\end{align}
After elimination of $\phi$, a second order equation dependent on $V^2$ can be obtained.
Simplifying the terms and rearanging is giving the follwing \autoref{eq:transfer-func}.
\begin{align}
    &-P^2 - \frac{E^2}{X}Q + \bigg(\frac{E^2}{2X}\bigg)^2 \geq 0 \label{eq:transfer-func} \\[12pt]
    &P \leq \frac{E^2}{2X} \quad\text{for}\quad Q=0 \label{eq:simplified-transfer-p} \\[6pt]
    &Q \leq \frac{E^2}{4X} \quad\text{for}\quad P=0 \label{eq:simplified-transfer-q}
\end{align}
The easy intuitively accessed functions, which can be kept in mind are \autoref{eq:simplified-transfer-p} and \autoref{eq:simplified-transfer-q}.
These represent the functions of the voltage dependent on the real power, when setting the reacitve power to zero, and vice versa. 
This accounts for power factors of $\cos \phi = 0$ or respectively $\sin \phi = 0$, or translated to the angle itself $\phi = \{0^\circ; 90^\circ\}$.
\footnote{for all angles in the interval of $\phi = [0^\circ, 180^\circ]$}
One note to take here, is that the power factor is not consistently used.
For load flow calculations mostly the sine and cosine representation of the angle between current and voltage is used, for stability analysis, often the tangent function is preferred.
A table and plot comparison of relations between the functions $\cos$, $\sin$, and $\tan$ are included in the appendix \autoref{app:trogonometric-func-comp}. 
This also leads to the dependency of $\tan \phi$ in the plotting of the so called Nose Curves, the result of when one is plotting the solutions of \autoref{eq:transfer-func}.

\end{figure}

\commenting{Describe the Nose Curves here briefly: What can one see and extract from that?}
The typical nose shape is visible for a simple network, with only considering reactances $X$ as attributes of the line or transportation grid.
Directly visible, that no static solution can be found, when surpassing a certain level of real power. 
This maximum often is referred to as the power transfer limit of the grid or network.


\commenting{
    Comment on $X$: If completely reactive then Nose curve shape, if real part in there, then form is drastically changing.
    There is a more complex illustration in 3D with axis P-Q-V.

% \label{sec:continuation-power-flow}

\subsection{Stability Indices for Time Series Calculation}
\label{sec:stability-indices}

\sidenote{Basic idea\\and references}
The idea behind stability indices is monitoring the current voltage stability state of the power system in relation to the critical point.
This applies not only to static load flow cases, but for time series calculations of short circuits, load shedding or other disturbances.
Therefore the dynamic contribution can be included as well. \quelle

Reviewing possible indices, either for online resp. real time monitoring or for subsequent analysis after a simulation, is out of the scope of this thesis.
\textcite{danish_2015} has already included an extensive review in his work, with reference to \textcite{doigcardet_2010}, which is focussing on indices in interest for this thesis in particular. 
\commenting{Jacobian Matrix based interesting, because of the possible observability in \textit{diffpssi}.}

\sidenote{The basics of the Jacobian Matrix}
One easy idea for obtaining a stable operation is looking at the Jacobian Matrix. 
Although it is mainly used in load flow calculations, it is possible to derive statements about the voltage stability as well.
This can be realized through the relation of real power $P$, reactive power $Q$, voltage angle $\delta$, and the voltage resp. voltage gradients $\Delta V$. 
If the Jacobian Matrix is getting singular, the System will not remain in a stable operation.
Singularity of matrices is checked by following two hypothesis tests:
\begin{align}
    &\det(\mab{J})=0 \label{eq:jacobian-det} \\[12pt]
    &J \times J^{-1} \uparrow \label{eq:jacobian-rank}
\end{align}
The Jacobian Matrix is defined as:
% \sidenote(5.2cm){Jacobian Matrix}
\begin{align}
    \mab{J}=
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \Delta \mab{P} \\
        \Delta \mab{Q}
    \end{bmatrix}&=
    \begin{bNiceArray}{c|c}
        \mab{H} & \mab{M'} \\ \hline
        \mab{N} & \mab{K'}
    \end{bNiceArray} \cdot
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \Delta \delta \\
        \Delta V/V
    \end{bmatrix} \notag \\[12pt]
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \Delta P_1 \\
        \vdots \\
        \Delta P_n \\ \hline
        \Delta Q_1 \\
        \vdots \\
        \Delta Q_n
    \end{bmatrix}&=
    \begin{bNiceArray}{ccc|ccc}
        \frac{\partial P_1}{\partial \delta_1} & \hdots & \frac{\partial P_1}{\partial \delta_n} & V_1\frac{\partial P_1}{\partial V_1} & \hdots & V_n\frac{\partial P_1}{\partial V_n} \\
        \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
        \frac{\partial P_n}{\partial \delta_1} & \hdots & \frac{\partial P_n}{\partial \delta_n} & V_1\frac{\partial P_n}{\partial V_1} & \hdots & V_n\frac{\partial P_n}{\partial V_n} \\ \hline
        \frac{\partial Q_1}{\partial \delta_1} & \hdots & \frac{\partial Q_1}{\partial \delta_n} & V_1\frac{\partial Q_1}{\partial V_1} & \hdots & V_n\frac{\partial Q_1}{\partial V_n} \\
        \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
        \frac{\partial Q_n}{\partial \delta_1} & \hdots & \frac{\partial Q_n}{\partial \delta_n} & V_1\frac{\partial Q_n}{\partial V_1} & \hdots & V_n\frac{\partial Q_n}{\partial V_n} \\
    \end{bNiceArray} \cdot
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \Delta \delta_1 \\
        \vdots \\
        \Delta \delta_n \\ \hline
        \Delta V_1/V_1 \\
        \vdots \\
        \Delta V_n/V_n
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}

Although this method seems easy to implement, there are some numerical problems realted to that.
Checking if a Matrix is singular with numerical methods, can only be realised as a probablilty expression. 
A result could be, that the determinant of the matrix is below a certain threshold. 
The algorithm would propose, that the matrix is probabilistic singular. \quelle

\sidenote{Indices adressing numerical problems}
This problem leads to the necessity of applying other methods or indices for stability assessment. 
Further, the relation of the system state to the critical voltage collapse point is highly nonlinear in the Jacobian Matrix. 
This problem is adressed by the indices in various ways, leading to a more or less linearized relation. 
\quelle \textcite{danish_2015} is proposing a few other indices, that are based on the Jacobian Matrix, and shows comparitive characteristics between Jacobian Matrix and system variable based voltage stability indices. 
These Jacobian Matrix based indices are listed and further described in \autoref{app:jacobian-voltage-indices}, while the comparative characteristics are described in \autoref{app:jacobian-vs-system-indices}. 
The aforeside mentioned work of \textcite{doigcardet_2010} is focussing on these indices in particular.

For this thesis, the indices in \autoref{tab:considered-indices} are chosen on the basis of the work of \textcite{danish_2015} and \textcite{doigcardet_2010}. 
They will be implemented in the Python framework in \autoref{sec:application-voltage-stability}, and used for with the theoretical calculated limits of \autoref{sec:analytical-voltage-stability} and \autoref{sec:continuation-power-flow}.

\section{Power System Modeling}

The simulation of power systems is a crucial tool, not only for stability studies, but for evaluating extensions or modifications in the planning process, the development of Assistance systems for operational management, and many other applications. \quelle 
Due to the complexity of the systems, simulations are often simplified. 
Not only with model constraints, bus as well in the way of calculations. 
Mainly seperating between \acf{EMT} and \acf{RMS} simulations, the latter is used in this thesis. 
The \autoref{app:power-system-modeling} is giving more details, literature, and summarizing the processes behind the used tool \textit{diffpssi}, if the reader is further interested in the topic.

% \sidenote{Basics}
Typical for \acs{RMS}-modeling is the usage of sequence components, especially the positive sequence for symmetrical grid operation and test cases. \quelle 
An equivalent circuit for the positive sequence is shown in \autoref{fig:trafo-model} part a), respectively reduced to the transformer ratio, the series impedances of the windings on the \acs{LV} and \acs{HV} side, and the shunt branch affected by iron and magnetization losses. \autocite{machowski_2020,kundur_2022,milano_2010}

The transformer ratio is typically noted as $\underline{\vartheta}$. 
Generally speaking it is the ratio between the number of windings of the secondary side to the primary side, as noted in \autoref{eq:trafo-ratio-easy}. 
With the typically used calculation unit \glqq per unit\grqq\footnote{means standardization to a reference value; further information on page \pageref{chap:symbols} and \textcite{machowski_2020}, Appendix A}, the ratio becomes one in the standard case. 
A transformer ratio, which is only shifting current angles with the shifting angle $\phi$, is represented through a complex number using the Euler Identity, as shown in \autoref{eq:trafo-ratio}.
\begin{align}
    \vartheta&=\frac{N_2}{N_1} \label{eq:trafo-ratio-easy} \\[6pt]
    \underline{\vartheta}&=\frac{N_2}{N_1} \cdot \exp(j \cdot \phi \cdot \frac{\pi}{180})\label{eq:trafo-ratio}
\end{align}

    \label{fig:trafo-model}
\end{figure}

\sidenote{Simplifications}
The first simplification is step is considering two assumptions. 
First, the iron and magnetization losses are neglectable. 
This can be illustrated with a short-circuit test of the transformer on the secondary side. 
During this test, one can obtain with the concept of a voltage devider, that
\begin{align}
    \underline{U}_\mathrm{Fe, \mu} \ll \underline{U}_\mathrm{T,rated}, \notag
\end{align}
meaning that the shunt branch impedance is much greater that the series impedance of the transformer. 
Secondly, it is assumed, that the on the primary side related impedance of the secondary side, is equal to the impedance on the primary side. 
This leads to a symmetrical circuit of the transformer and the positive sequence equivalent circuit simplifies to \autoref{fig:trafo-model} part b). 
Mathematically this is shortly expressable as \autoref{eq:related-impedances}, \autoref{eq:trafo-symmetrical}, and \autoref{eq:series-impedance}. \autocite{machowski_2020,kundur_2022,milano_2010}
\begin{align}
    \underline{Z}_1 &= R_1 + jX_1\text{;}\quad\underline{Z}_2 = R_2 \vartheta^2 + jX_2 \vartheta^2 \label{eq:related-impedances} \\
    \underline{Z}_1 &= \underline{Z}_2 \label{eq:trafo-symmetrical} \\
    \underline{Z}_\mathrm{T} &= \underline{Z}_1 + \underline{Z}_2 \label{eq:series-impedance}
\end{align}
The afore described simplification leads to only the necessity of considering the series impedance. 
Considering the afore mentioned normal ratio of $\vartheta=1$ in the per unit system, the Python framework \textit{diffpssi} has been using this model with only the series impedance and no variable ratio, meaning no shunt branches, before.

\sidenote{Introducing variable transformer ratios}
When one wants to look at variable transformer ratios, either with representing vector groups, or implementing \acfp{OLTC}, this model of only considering the series impedance has to be extended. 
Using shunt branches, the variable ratio behavior can be represented in a $\Pi$-model, as shown in \autoref{fig:pi-transformer}. \autocite{machowski_2020,kundur_2022,milano_2010}

\begin{figure}%[htb!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{tikz_graphics/images/transformer_pi.pdf}
    \caption[$\Pi$-representative circuit of an idealized transformer with a tap changer]{$\Pi$-representative circuit of an idealized transformer with a tap changer; own figure after \autocite{milano_2010,burlakin_2024}}
    \label{fig:pi-transformer}
\end{figure}

Looking at the transformer as a black box two-port, with the index one being the \acs{LV} side, the index two being the \acs{HV} side, the admittance matrix for the variable ratio behavior can be expressed as in \autoref{eq:admittance-behavior}. 
The voltages and current are defined as in \autoref{fig:trafo-model} part b). 
With rearranging the equation, one can obtain the admittance matrix of the $\Pi$-model with to the \acs{HV} side related values as in \autoref{eq:admittance-matrix-pi}. \autocite{milano_2010,burlakin_2024}

\begin{align}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        {\color{ees_green}\underline{\vartheta}^*} \underline{I}_1 \\ \underline{I}_2
    \end{bmatrix}&= 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \underline{Y}_\mathrm{T} & -\underline{Y}_\mathrm{T} \\
        -\underline{Y}_\mathrm{T} & \underline{Y}_\mathrm{T}
    \end{bmatrix} \cdot
    \begin{bmatrix}
        {\color{ees_green}\frac{1}{\underline{\vartheta}}}~\underline{U}_1 \\ \underline{U}_2
    \end{bmatrix} \label{eq:admittance-behavior} \\[12pt]
    \underline{\mab{Y}}_\mathrm{\Pi,T}&=\underline{Y}_\mathrm{T} \cdot
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \frac{1}{\underline{\vartheta}\underline{\vartheta}^*} & -\frac{1}{\underline{\vartheta}^*} \\
        -\frac{1}{\underline{\vartheta}} & 1
    \end{bmatrix} \label{eq:admittance-matrix-pi}
\end{align}

For calculation of the individual shunt branches, one can apply the standard representation of two-ports consistent of a linear $\Pi$-circuit:
\begin{align}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \underline{I}_1 \\ \underline{I}_2
    \end{bmatrix}=
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \underline{Y}_{10} + \underline{Y}_{12}& -\underline{Y}_{12} \\
        -\underline{Y}_{21} & \underline{Y}_{20} + \underline{Y}_{21}
    \end{bmatrix} \cdot
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \underline{U}_1 \\ \underline{U}_2
    \end{bmatrix} \notag % \label{eq:shunt-calc}
\end{align}
When equating this with \autoref{eq:admittance-matrix-pi}, the shunt branches can be calculated respectivly giving the admittances written down as \autoref{eq:y-12}, \autoref{eq:y-10}, and \autoref{eq:y-20}, as they are noted in \autoref{fig:pi-transformer} as well. \autocite{milano_2010,burlakin_2024}
\begin{align}
    \underline{Y}_{12}&=\frac{1}{\underline{\vartheta} \cdot \underline{a}_\mathrm{T}^*} \cdot \underline{Y}_\mathrm{T}\text{, and} \notag \\[6pt]
    \underline{Y}_{21}&=\frac{1}{\underline{\vartheta} \cdot \underline{a}_\mathrm{T}} \cdot \underline{Y}_\mathrm{T} \label{eq:y-12} \\[12pt]
    \underline{Y}_{10}&=\frac{1}{\underline{\vartheta}} \cdot \bigg(\frac{1}{\underline{\vartheta}} - \frac{1}{\underline{a}_\mathrm{T}}\bigg) \cdot \underline{Y}_\mathrm{T} \label{eq:y-10} \\[12pt]
    \underline{Y}_{20}&=\bigg(1 - \frac{1}{\underline{\vartheta} \cdot \underline{a}_\mathrm{T}}\bigg) \cdot \underline{Y}_\mathrm{T} \label{eq:y-20}
\end{align}

% After MACHOWSKI:
% \begin{align}
%     \underline{\mab{Y}}_\mathrm{\Pi,T}&= 
%     \begin{bmatrix}
%         \underline{Y}_\mathrm{T} & -\underline{\vartheta}\underline{Y}_\mathrm{T} \\
%         \underline{\vartheta}^*\underline{Y}_\mathrm{T} & -\underline{\vartheta}^*\underline{\vartheta}\underline{Y}_\mathrm{T}
%     \end{bmatrix} \label{eq:admittance-oltc}
% \end{align}
% Another way of writing down the admittance matrix is shown in \autoref{eq:admittance-oltc-2}. It is considering, that the matrix can be split up in a symmetric, constant part, and a variable current injection part. The latter is not symmetrical and depends on the tap position of the transformer. Therefore in some simulation algorithms the static part is used in the admittance matrix, and the variable part is considered in the current injection vector. \autocite{machowski_2020}



\sidenote{Per unit system\\specialities}
Reactances and resistances are referred to the base voltage and apparent power of the operational unit, such as the transformer. 
The power system simulation uses its own base voltage and base apparent power, enabling the use of one single calculation domain. 
This is done to simplify the calculation and to make the results easily comparable to each other. 
Hence, the reffered values have to be transformed from the equipment based values to the simulation based values. 
The relation for the transformer admittance is defined as follows. 
Generally speaking, this thesis is using and reffering to the per unit based values, although it is not denoted in the index of the values.
\begin{align}
    \underline{Y}_\mathrm{T,~based}&=\underline{Y}_\mathrm{T} \cdot \frac{S_\mathrm{n}}{S_\mathrm{n,~sim}} \label{eq:y-t-based} \\[6pt]
    \underline{Z}_\mathrm{line,~based}&=\underline{Z}_\mathrm{line} \cdot \frac{S_\mathrm{n,~sim}}{V_\mathrm{n,~sim}^2} \label{eq:y-line-based}
\end{align}
Displayed like in \autoref{eq:y-t-based}, the characteristic of the operational unit is referred to the simulation base value. 
Here, the admittance of the transformer is multiplied with its own rated apparent power, then devided by the apparent power of the simulation system. 
Similar, the impedance of the lines are calculated via \autoref{eq:y-line-based}. 
This specialities are considered in the tap changer modeling, thus further information is given in \autocite{machowski_2020}, Appendix A.

\subsection{Open-Source Power System Simulation tools}
\label{sec:simulation-tools}

For this thesis relevant are mainly two Power System Simulation tools.
The first and main objective, \textit{diffpssi} is an open source project from Georg Kordowich, member of the chair hosting this thesis.
This open source tool provides a \acs{RMS} domain simulation of Power Systems, considering passive grid elements like lines, shunts, loads etc., but dynamic and controlled models like Synchronous Machines, Inverters or similar as well.
The project and the integration of a full Synchronous Machine model is presented in the published paper of \textcite{kordowich_2023}.
The project is based on little dependencies like numpy, but can as well use the Python module \textit{PyTorch} as backend.
\textit{PyTorch} allows for differentiation of simulation variables.
With this, optimzation of grid and machine parameters is possible.
Future extension and usage in the topics like voltage stability and resp. or control strategies is likely as well.

The second relevant tool is a commercial software called \textit{PowerFactory} by the company \textit{DIgSILENT}.
Modeling of the power system elements is described in its technical references, but not open source like \textit{diffpssi}.

\section{On-Load Tap Changer Controls}

\subsection{Commonly Used On-Load Tap Changer Control}

A few basics are in the interest, understanding differences between real world beahavior, or possible ways of building up a \acs{OLTC} transformer control. 
This control theory difference can be limiting as well for the results and objectives compared to the actual possible control in the field.

% \subsubsection{Typical presets are manually set}
\sidenote{Typical presets are manually set}
The target voltage is typically set from the control room of the grid operator, coming from pre-calculated load flow analysis. 
This can be set hours before, or even day-ahead with the estimated loads of the grid. 
This value is set locally for each operating unit subsequently. 
The control is then operating locally and without further involvement of the grid operator. \quelle

% \subsubsection{Discrete controllers are used in the field}
\sidenote{Discrete controllers are used in the field}
Typically the used controller in the field is a discrete controller, which can change tap positions under load within a time frame of around few seconds. 
Practical tap steps are around $2~\mathrm{\%}$ of the overall transforming ratio. 
The control is set up with a dead band, to avoid unnecessary tap changes. 
It is necessecary to note here, that this control and its mathematical caracteristics contains logical elements, blocks, and delays, which cannot be translated in a typical control theory transmission function. 
This leads to the missing possibility to easily obtain mathematical stability for the control of the overall considered power system. \quelle
