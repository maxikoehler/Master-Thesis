\section{Research Interests}

Here are gaps and possible extension of knowledge.

Here are the research objectives and questions.

\commenting{
    \begin{itemize}[nosep]
        \item Influence of OLTC control on possible operational uses: Short-term voltage stability, long-term voltage stability; 
        \item Can a increased dynamic regulation help machine recovery?
        \item Does the increased tap ratio gradient harm transient stability of machines?
        Does it help or harm CCT of machines or machine groups?
        \item Transformers act as big low-pass filters: Can this behavior be beneficial as well for the interactions of inverters in the grid on AC side (in the sense of Harmonic Stability)? \quelle
    \end{itemize}
}

    How do different control types and characteristics of Tap Changing transformers influence the voltage stability of the given system?
\end{tcolorbox}

Therefore following questions/steps can be imagined as supportive:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How can Voltage stability of a system be classified and be looked at? Which indices, measurements, etc.
    \item Which transformer model has to be considered to show influences?
    \item Which systems are useful to consider in showing effects? Which circumstances lead to a stability support, which to a decrease? Where can limits be drawn?
\end{enumerate}

Additionally during the process of the thesis, the following question came up as an extension. Is is the second interest of this thesis, and shall be more focused in the later part. Therefore some assessments in the \autoref{chap:case-study} are conducted.

    Can the already existing Tap Changer Control of the \acf{FSM} be improved towards a more operation oriented control?
\end{tcolorbox}

The afore stated research interests in combination with the yet not sufficient framework to use make demands on the structure of this work. Therefore it seems not sufficient trying to apply a completely standard sequence of chapter like \glqq Introduction - Fundamentals - Methods - Results - Discussion\grqq. Instead, the following structure is chosen to fulfill the research interests and to give a clear and understandable overview of the work.

\subsection{Stability Indices for Time Series Calculation}
\label{sec:stability-indices}

\sidenote{Basic idea and references}
The idea behind stability indices is monitoring the current voltage stability state of the power system in relation to the critical point. This applies not only to static load flow cases, but for time series calculations of short circuits, load shedding or other disturbances. Therefore the dynamic contribution can be included as well. \quelle

Reviewing possible indices, either for online resp. real time monitoring or for subsequent analysis after a simulation, is out of the scope of this thesis. \textcite{danishVoltageStabilityElectric2015} has already included an extensive review in his work, with reference to \textcite{doigcardetAnalysisVoltageStability2010}, which is focussing on indices in interest for this thesis in particular. \commenting{Jacobian Matrix based interesting, because of the possible observability in \textit{diffpssi}.}

\sidenote{The basics of the Jacobian Matrix}
One easy idea for obtaining a stable operation is looking at the Jacobian Matrix. Although it is mainly used in load flow calculations, it is possible to derive statements about the voltage stability as well. This can be realized through the relation of real power $P$, reactive power $Q$, voltage angle $\delta$, and the voltage resp. voltage gradients $\Delta V$. If the Jacobian Matrix is getting singular, the System will not remain in a stable operation. Singularity of matrices is checked by following two hypothesis tests:
\begin{align}
    &\det(\mab{J})=0 \label{eq:jacobian-det} \\[12pt]
    &J \times J^{-1} \uparrow \label{eq:jacobian-rank}
\end{align}
The Jacobian Matrix is defined as:
% \sidenote(5.2cm){Jacobian Matrix}
\begin{align}
    \mab{J}=
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \Delta \mab{P} \\

    \end{bmatrix}&=
    \begin{bNiceArray}{c|c}
        \mab{H} & \mab{M'} \\ \hline
        \mab{N} & \mab{K'}
    \end{bNiceArray} \cdot

        \Delta \delta \\
        \Delta V/V
    \end{bmatrix} \notag \\[12pt]
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \Delta P_1 \\
        \vdots \\
        \Delta P_n \\ \hline

        \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
        \frac{\partial P_n}{\partial \delta_1} & \hdots & \frac{\partial P_n}{\partial \delta_n} & V_1\frac{\partial P_n}{\partial V_1} & \hdots & V_n\frac{\partial P_n}{\partial V_n} \\ \hline
        \frac{\partial Q_1}{\partial \delta_1} & \hdots & \frac{\partial Q_1}{\partial \delta_n} & V_1\frac{\partial Q_1}{\partial V_1} & \hdots & V_n\frac{\partial Q_1}{\partial V_n} \\
        \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
        \frac{\partial Q_n}{\partial \delta_1} & \hdots & \frac{\partial Q_n}{\partial \delta_n} & V_1\frac{\partial Q_n}{\partial V_1} & \hdots & V_n\frac{\partial Q_n}{\partial V_n} \\
    \end{bNiceArray} \cdot
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \Delta \delta_1 \\
        \vdots \\
        \Delta \delta_n \\ \hline
        \Delta V_1/V_1 \\
        \vdots \\
        \Delta V_n/V_n
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}

Although this method seems easy to implement, there are some numerical problems realted to that. Checking if a Matrix is singular with numerical methods, can only be realised as a probablilty expression. A result could be, that the determinant of the matrix is below a certain threshold. The algorithm would propose, that the matrix is probabilistic singular. \quelle

\sidenote{Indices adressing numerical problems}
This problem leads to the necessity of applying other methods or indices for stability assessment. Further, the relation of the system state to the critical voltage collapse point is highly nonlinear in the Jacobian Matrix. This problem is adressed by the indices in various ways, leading to a more or less linearized relation. \quelle \textcite{danishVoltageStabilityElectric2015} is proposing a few other indices, that are based on the Jacobian Matrix, and shows comparitive characteristics between Jacobian Matrix and system variable based voltage stability indices. These Jacobian Matrix based indices are listed and further described in \autoref{app:jacobian-voltage-indices}, while the comparative characteristics are described in \autoref{app:jacobian-vs-system-indices}. The aforeside mentioned work of \textcite{doigcardetAnalysisVoltageStability2010} is focussing on these indices in particular.

For this thesis, the indices in \autoref{tab:considered-indices} are chosen on the basis of the work of \textcite{danishVoltageStabilityElectric2015} and \textcite{doigcardetAnalysisVoltageStability2010}. They will be implemented in the Python framework in \autoref{sec:application-voltage-stability}, and used for with the theoretical calculated limits of \autoref{sec:analytical-voltage-stability} and \autoref{sec:continuation-power-flow}.

\section{Power System Modeling}

The simulation of power systems is a crucial tool, not only for stability studies, but for evaluating extensions or modifications in the planning process, the development of Assistance systems for operational management, and many other applications. \quelle Due to the complexity of the systems, simulations are often simplified. Not only with model constraints, bus as well in the way of calculations. Mainly seperating between \acf{EMT} and \acf{RMS} simulations, the latter is used in this thesis. The \autoref{app:power-system-modeling} is giving more details, literature, and summarizing the processes behind the used tool \textit{diffpssi}, if the reader is further interested in the topic.

\subsection{Transformer Electric Model and Behavior}

%     \caption[Two-Winding Transformer Circuit in the Positive Sequence]{Two-Winding Transformer Circuit in the Positive Sequence; a) ideal representation with impedances on each \acs{HV} and \acs{LV} side and b) related impedances on the XX side; own figure after \autocite{machowskiPowerSystemDynamics2020}}
%     \label{fig:trafo-model-deviation}
% \end{figure}

% \sidenote{Basics}
Typical for \acs{RMS}-modeling is the usage of sequence components, especially the positive sequence for symmetrical grid operation and test cases. \quelle An equivalent circuit for the positive sequence is shown in \autoref{fig:trafo-model} part a), respectively reduced to the transformer ratio, the series impedances of the windings on the \acs{LV} and \acs{HV} side, and the shunt branch affected by iron and magnetization losses. \autocite{machowskiPowerSystemDynamics2020,kundurPowerSystemStability2022,milanoPowerSystemModelling2010}

The transformer ratio is typically noted as $\underline{\vartheta}$. Generally speaking it is the ratio between the number of windings of the secondary side to the primary side, as noted in \autoref{eq:trafo-ratio-easy}. With the typically used calculation unit \glqq per unit\grqq\footnote{means standardization to a reference value; further information on page \pageref{chap:symbols} and \textcite{machowskiPowerSystemDynamics2020}, Appendix A}, the ratio becomes one in the standard case. A transformer ratio, which is only shifting current angles with the shifting angle $\phi$, is represented through a complex number using the Euler Identity, as shown in \autoref{eq:trafo-ratio}.
\begin{align}
    \vartheta&=\frac{N_2}{N_1} \label{eq:trafo-ratio-easy} \\[6pt]
    \underline{\vartheta}&=\frac{N_2}{N_1} \cdot \exp(j \cdot \phi \cdot \frac{\pi}{180})\label{eq:trafo-ratio}
\end{align}

    \label{fig:trafo-model}
\end{figure}

\sidenote{Simplifications}
The first simplification is step is considering two assumptions. First, the iron and magnetization losses are neglectable. This can be illustrated with a short-circuit test of the transformer on the secondary side. During this test, one can obtain with the concept of a voltage devider, that
\begin{align}
    \underline{U}_\mathrm{Fe, \mu} \ll \underline{U}_\mathrm{T,rated}, \notag
\end{align}
meaning that the shunt branch impedance is much greater that the series impedance of the transformer. Secondly, it is assumed, that the on the primary side related impedance of the secondary side, is equal to the impedance on the primary side. This leads to a symmetrical circuit of the transformer and the positive sequence equivalent circuit simplifies to \autoref{fig:trafo-model} part b). Mathematically this is shortly expressable as \autoref{eq:related-impedances}, \autoref{eq:trafo-symmetrical}, and \autoref{eq:series-impedance}. \autocite{machowskiPowerSystemDynamics2020,kundurPowerSystemStability2022,milanoPowerSystemModelling2010}
\begin{align}
    \underline{Z}_1 &= R_1 + jX_1\text{;}\quad\underline{Z}_2 = R_2 \vartheta^2 + jX_2 \vartheta^2 \label{eq:related-impedances} \\
    \underline{Z}_1 &= \underline{Z}_2 \label{eq:trafo-symmetrical} \\
    \underline{Z}_\mathrm{T} &= \underline{Z}_1 + \underline{Z}_2 \label{eq:series-impedance}
\end{align}
The afore described simplification leads to only the necessity of considering the series impedance. Considering the afore mentioned normal ratio of $\vartheta=1$ in the per unit system, the Python framework \textit{diffpssi} has been using this model with only the series impedance and no variable ratio, meaning no shunt branches, before.

\sidenote{Introducing variable transformer ratios}
When one wants to look at variable transformer ratios, either with representing vector groups, or implementing \acfp{OLTC}, this model of only considering the series impedance has to be extended. Using shunt branches, the variable ratio behavior can be represented in a $\Pi$-model, as shown in \autoref{fig:pi-transformer}. \autocite{machowskiPowerSystemDynamics2020,kundurPowerSystemStability2022,milanoPowerSystemModelling2010}

\begin{figure}%[htb!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{tikz_graphics/images/transformer_pi.pdf}
    \caption[$\Pi$-representative circuit of an idealized transformer with a tap changer]{$\Pi$-representative circuit of an idealized transformer with a tap changer; own figure after \autocite{milanoPowerSystemModelling2010,burlakinEnhancedVoltageControl2024}}
    \label{fig:pi-transformer}
\end{figure}

Looking at the transformer as a black box two-port, with the index one being the \acs{LV} side, the index two being the \acs{HV} side, the admittance matrix for the variable ratio behavior can be expressed as in \autoref{eq:admittance-behavior}. The voltages and current are defined as in \autoref{fig:trafo-model} part b). With rearranging the equation, one can obtain the admittance matrix of the $\Pi$-model with to the \acs{HV} side related values as in \autoref{eq:admittance-matrix-pi}. \autocite{milanoPowerSystemModelling2010,burlakinEnhancedVoltageControl2024}

\begin{align}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        {\color{ees_green}\underline{\vartheta}^*} \underline{I}_1 \\ \underline{I}_2
    \end{bmatrix}&= 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \underline{Y}_\mathrm{T} & -\underline{Y}_\mathrm{T} \\
        -\underline{Y}_\mathrm{T} & \underline{Y}_\mathrm{T}
    \end{bmatrix} \cdot
    \begin{bmatrix}
        {\color{ees_green}\frac{1}{\underline{\vartheta}}}~\underline{U}_1 \\ \underline{U}_2
    \end{bmatrix} \label{eq:admittance-behavior} \\[12pt]
    \underline{\mab{Y}}_\mathrm{\Pi,T}&=\underline{Y}_\mathrm{T} \cdot
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \frac{1}{\underline{\vartheta}\underline{\vartheta}^*} & -\frac{1}{\underline{\vartheta}^*} \\
        -\frac{1}{\underline{\vartheta}} & 1
    \end{bmatrix} \label{eq:admittance-matrix-pi}
\end{align}

For calculation of the individual shunt branches, one can apply the standard representation of two-ports consistent of a linear $\Pi$-circuit:
\begin{align}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \underline{I}_1 \\ \underline{I}_2
    \end{bmatrix}=
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \underline{Y}_{10} + \underline{Y}_{12}& -\underline{Y}_{12} \\
        -\underline{Y}_{21} & \underline{Y}_{20} + \underline{Y}_{21}
    \end{bmatrix} \cdot
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \underline{U}_1 \\ \underline{U}_2
    \end{bmatrix} \notag % \label{eq:shunt-calc}
\end{align}
When equating this with \autoref{eq:admittance-matrix-pi}, the shunt branches can be calculated respectivly giving the admittances written down as \autoref{eq:y-12}, \autoref{eq:y-10}, and \autoref{eq:y-20}, as they are noted in \autoref{fig:pi-transformer} as well. \autocite{milanoPowerSystemModelling2010,burlakinEnhancedVoltageControl2024}
\begin{align}
    \underline{Y}_{12}&=\frac{1}{\underline{\vartheta} \cdot \underline{a}_\mathrm{T}^*} \cdot \underline{Y}_\mathrm{T}\text{, and} \notag \\[6pt]
    \underline{Y}_{21}&=\frac{1}{\underline{\vartheta} \cdot \underline{a}_\mathrm{T}} \cdot \underline{Y}_\mathrm{T} \label{eq:y-12} \\[12pt]
    \underline{Y}_{10}&=\frac{1}{\underline{\vartheta}} \cdot \bigg(\frac{1}{\underline{\vartheta}} - \frac{1}{\underline{a}_\mathrm{T}}\bigg) \cdot \underline{Y}_\mathrm{T} \label{eq:y-10} \\[12pt]
    \underline{Y}_{20}&=\bigg(1 - \frac{1}{\underline{\vartheta} \cdot \underline{a}_\mathrm{T}}\bigg) \cdot \underline{Y}_\mathrm{T} \label{eq:y-20}
\end{align}

% After MACHOWSKI:
% \begin{align}
%     \underline{\mab{Y}}_\mathrm{\Pi,T}&= 
%     \begin{bmatrix}
%         \underline{Y}_\mathrm{T} & -\underline{\vartheta}\underline{Y}_\mathrm{T} \\
%         \underline{\vartheta}^*\underline{Y}_\mathrm{T} & -\underline{\vartheta}^*\underline{\vartheta}\underline{Y}_\mathrm{T}
%     \end{bmatrix} \label{eq:admittance-oltc}
% \end{align}
% Another way of writing down the admittance matrix is shown in \autoref{eq:admittance-oltc-2}. It is considering, that the matrix can be split up in a symmetric, constant part, and a variable current injection part. The latter is not symmetrical and depends on the tap position of the transformer. Therefore in some simulation algorithms the static part is used in the admittance matrix, and the variable part is considered in the current injection vector. \autocite{machowskiPowerSystemDynamics2020}

\sidenote{Per unit system\\specialities}
Reactances and resistances are referred to the base voltage and apparent power of the operational unit, such as the transformer. The power system simulation uses its own base voltage and base apparent power, enabling the use of one single calculation domain. This is done to simplify the calculation and to make the results easily comparable to each other. Hence, the reffered values have to be transformed from the equipment based values to the simulation based values. The relation for the transformer admittance is defined as follows. Generally speaking, this thesis is using and reffering to the per unit based values, although it is not denoted in the index of the values.
\begin{align}
    \underline{Y}_\mathrm{T,~based}&=\underline{Y}_\mathrm{T} \cdot \frac{S_\mathrm{n}}{S_\mathrm{n,~sim}} \label{eq:y-t-based} \\[6pt]
    \underline{Z}_\mathrm{line,~based}&=\underline{Z}_\mathrm{line} \cdot \frac{S_\mathrm{n,~sim}}{V_\mathrm{n,~sim}^2} \label{eq:y-line-based}
\end{align}
Displayed like in \autoref{eq:y-t-based}, the characteristic of the operational unit is referred to the simulation base value. Here, the admittance of the transformer is multiplied with its own rated apparent power, then devided by the apparent power of the simulation system. Similar, the impedance of the lines are calculated via \autoref{eq:y-line-based}. This specialities are considered in the tap changer modeling, thus further information is given in \autocite{machowskiPowerSystemDynamics2020}, Appendix A.

\section{Commonly Used On-Load Tap Changer Control}

A few basics are in the interest, understanding differences between real world beahavior, or possible ways of building up a \acs{OLTC} transformer control. This control theory difference can be limiting as well for the results and objectives compared to the actual possible control in the field.

% \subsubsection{Typical presets are manually set}
\sidenote{Typical presets are manually set}
The target voltage is typically set from the control room of the grid operator, coming from pre-calculated load flow analysis. This can be set hours before, or even day-ahead with the estimated loads of the grid. This value is set locally for each operating unit subsequently. The control is then operating locally and without further involvement of the grid operator. \quelle

% \subsubsection{Discrete controllers are used in the field}
\sidenote{Discrete controllers are used in the field}
Typically the used controller in the field is a discrete controller, which can change tap positions under load within a time frame of around few seconds. Practical tap steps are around $2~\mathrm{\%}$ of the overall transforming ratio. The control is set up with a dead band, to avoid unnecessary tap changes. It is necessecary to note here, that this control and its mathematical caracteristics contains logical elements, blocks, and delays, which cannot be translated in a typical control theory transmission function. This leads to the missing possibility to easily obtain mathematical stability for the control of the overall considered power system. \quelle
