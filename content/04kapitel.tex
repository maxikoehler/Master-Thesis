\section{Representative Electrical Networks}

The following section shall introduce the used power systems in the simulation with the Python framework, considering verification, and also extension meaning the performed case studies in \autoref{chap:case-study}. The models are chosen to represent different network sizes and complexities, thus allowing the objective of graded interaction levels of the developed (transformer) model. The models are based on the work of \textcite{machowskiPowerSystemDynamics2020}, \textcite{kundurPowerSystemStability2022}, \textcite{IEEEGuideLoad2022}, and \textcite{vancutsemTestSystemsVoltage2020}.

\subsubsection{Single Machine Infinite Bus (SMIB) Model}

One very popular and thus powerful electrical network for the verification of power system stability is the \acs{SMIB} model. It is a compact and simplified model of a power system, allowing easy analytical calculation, verification and development. Mutual influences are comparably simple to understand and calculate, as the infinite bus bus is acting as a fixed grid connection point with a large adjoining grid. The generator is connected to the bus bar via a transmission line and a transformer. The model was largely discussed by \textcite{kundurPowerSystemStability2022}, and is shown in Figure \ref{fig:smib-model}. The generator and the \acs{IBB} are represented by synchronous machines, developed and discussed by \textcite{kordowichPhysicsInformedMachine2023}. The specific model details are included in \autoref{app:smib-model}, additionally the simulation setup for verification is described in \autoref{tab:smib-model}.

\subsubsection{Simple Single Machine Load Model}

Follwing model is often recommended \quelle for easy voltage control studies, in explicit for \acsp{OLTC}. Similar to the \acs{SMIB} model, it consists from one synchronous generator, busses, and lines in a single branch. The \acs{IBB} is thus removed and changed to a load. This two element type o configuration allows for an easy analytical calculation of voltage stability and control. Although this thesis is focussing on \acs{OLTC} transformers, the model is extended with one in between. A single line representation is depicted in \autoref{fig:single-line-voltage-stability}.

\begin{figure}[htb!]

    \caption{Single line representation of a simple single machine load model; own illustration with characterstics from \quelle}
    \label{fig:single-line-voltage-stability}
\end{figure}

Further details about its configuration and simulation setup are included in \autoref{app:single-line-model}. It should be noted, that simple load models are not useful for simulation of this example network. Usually constant Z models are used as loads, therefore simulation results can be misleading and not showing desired effects or voltage instability mechanisms \quelle. \commenting{The simulation framework is extended with XX types of load models, to satisfy the requirements of the single machine load model, and a connected stability assessment.}

    In the interest of investigation / the Case Study are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Influence of switching times on stability margin/begin of destabilization,
        \item Influence of max. ratio change per switching event, and
        \item Influence on different test systems (destabilization mechanisms).
    \end{itemize}

\section{Scenario setting}

\commenting{
    Does it make sense to structure like that?

    Or is it a better idea thinking in terms of specific \glqq use cases\grqq~as sections:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What happens under strong grid conditions? -> Section: Strong grid condition behavior
        \item What happens under weak grid conditions? -> Section: Weak grid condition behavior
        \item Strongly interconnected grids
        \item Widely extended linear string grids
        \item Section: Use case of Wind farm integration
        \item Influence on transient stability: SMIB model with and without OLTC
