After exposure it was found that there was not a simple correlation between color and thermal history. Also, it was not evident after exposure that the hardness could be traced to the thermal history. However, it was clear that color did rely on pretreatment options. The abrasive treatment resulted in shades of gold with a polished look while the milder treatments produced matte hues of blue. All coupons after exposure were found to have an oxide layer thickness of no more than 400 nm.},

The morphology and distribution of the resulting platinum deposits are studied by SEM, EDS mapping and X-ray computed tomography. The active surface area of the electrode was assessed from the charge transfer current for the reduction of Ce(IV) ions and compared to that of planar and expanded metal mesh electrodes. The surface area was estimated by hydrogen electrosorption relative to that at a planar Pt/Ti electrode. As expected from the potential drop within the electrode channel, the individual micromesh near the cell separator showed a higher platinum content. Pt/Ti micromesh offers an extended surface area and enhanced mass transport compared to planar electrodes and conventional expanded metal mesh anodes. The applications for these and alternative electrode structures are discussed.},

The computation domain is obtained from X-ray computed tomography. The pore-scale study aims to investigate the counter-current transport of fluids within the spatially distributed structure with application to polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). The results indicate that the transport mechanism is gas fingering for a current density of 1.356~A~cm-2. The observed gas fingering is independent of the domain size, structure and boundary conditions in the studied ranges. But, the computed final local distribution of oxygen strongly depends on spatial porosity and pore size distributions. Furthermore, with different locations of the oxygen injection points along the invasion interface, different final saturation profiles are computed. The latter suggests the importance of oxygen entrance conditions, especially when the computational domain shall be realistically coupled with the catalyst layer along the oxygen invasion interface.},

  abstract = {Efficient hydrogen production by electrolysis of aqueous and aqueous-alcohol solutions is based on the use of electrode materials with a low overpotential of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Apart from materials containing noble metals (Pt, Pd, etc.), coatings consisting of the iron triad metals (Fe, Ni, Co) obtained by electroplating method on the substrate surface (nickel foam, carbon fibers) are used. However, there is a problem with the crystallites size and the coating degree of the substrate. The use of simple (non-complex) electrolytes doesn't solve them. This article is devoted to the preparation of composite Ni\textendash Co coatings from a complex citrate electrolyte by electrodeposition on carbon felt and their testing in an aqueous-alcoholic solution of KOH. The pH effect of the electrolyte on the morphology, structure, and electrochemical properties has been studied. The morphology and structure of synthesized coatings have been investigated using SEM and PXRD methods. The chemical composition of the samples has been determined by EDX spectroscopy. The electrochemical performance of the coatings has been evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry methods. The synthesized samples are carbon filaments with a submicron coating (300~nm) of the {$\alpha$}-Ni/{$\beta$}-Co composite. The crystallite sizes are 15~{$\pm~$}5~nm and depend on the pH value of the electrolyte used. It has been found that the use of nanocomposites reduced the overpotential of HER to -196~mV while maintaining their stability. Thus, the study shows that the use of a complex electrolyte based on citric acid allows obtaining nanoscale composite coatings of {$\alpha$}-Ni/{$\beta$}-Co on a carbon substrate. Changing the pH of the electrolyte makes it possible to vary the coating degree of the substrate and the Ni:Co ratio in the composite. A more detailed study of the observed overpotential shift to the anodic side remains an interesting issue.},

  abstract = {Porous transport layer(PTL) plays an important role in the electron and mass transport of the polymer electrolyte membrane(PEM) water electrolyzer. Through harsh conditions of long-term operation, acidic environment, high operating temperature, the forming of TiO2 on the surface of the Ti-PTL results in the PTL surface passivation. In this study, by combining two methods: spray-coating and thermal treatment, a thin layer of IrO2/TiO2 catalyst is deposited on the surface of the Ti-PTL to prevent the passivation and improve the performance of the PEM electrolyzer. The IrO2/TiO2 catalyst layer is expected to reduce the cell Ohmic resistance and improve the stability of the Ti-PTL due to preventing TiO2 formation. By controlling the synthesis process, 5 samples with different Ir loading (0 mgIr/cm2 (pristine), 0.21 mgIr/cm2, 0.39 mgIr/cm2, 0.60 mgIr/cm2, 0.94 mgIr/cm2) are evaluated to investigate the effect of IrO2/TiO2 catalyst loading on the water electrolysis cell performance. The results indicate that cell Ohmic resistances of IrO2/TiO2 catalyst coated PTLs are lower than the one of pristine PTL. Moreover, the polarization studies show that cell performance increases with the increase of catalyst loading. In our study, the catalyst loading of 0.60 mgIr/cm2 is expected as the optimum for PEM electrolyzer.},

  abstract = {From a sustainability perspective, a synergy between hydrogen, electricity and Renewable Energy Sources (RES) is particularly attractive. A combination of Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells and PEM electrolyzers provides a back-up system for RES avoiding the intermittency: electrolyzers convert the excess of energy from RES into hydrogen and PEM fuel cells use this hydrogen to convert it back into electricity when it is needed. Models are an essential tool in electrolyzer development because it allows to understand the influence of different parameters on the electrolyzer performance enabling an efficient simulation, design and optimization of electrolyzer systems. Modelling studies have been developed with different degrees of complexity. This review presents a compilation of published models focusing on the main equations used to predict cell voltage, including reversible voltage, activation losses, ohmic losses and mass transport losses. Special sections are devoted to dynamic behaviour, two-phase flow effects and inclusion of thermal effects in model development. Also, a brief description of empirical/semi-empirical models is provided. This review aims to provide the main guidelines for the beginners on PEM electrolyzer modelling and, for this purpose, includes a section with the technology basic principles.},

Here, we investigate the dynamic behavior of oxygen bubble in a PTL using a free surface model in a lattice Boltzmann framework. Various PTL properties are examined to gain a fundamental understanding of the bubble transport phenomena and perform effective bubble removal from the PTL at a high current density operation. We report on the bubble volume fraction and bubble distribution inside the PTL to elucidate the impact of the PTL properties on the bubble transport behavior. Oxygen bubble transport characteristics that determine the bubble removal time have been extensively studied. The findings will enable more reliable bubble management and the development of related high-power PEWE technologies.},

Iridium catalyst is expensive, and it is important to minimize its use and to optimize interface between Ir and ionomer or water for higher utilization of catalyst in oxygen evolution reaction. In this paper, x-ray computed tomography along with electrochemical and modeling techniques are used to characterize the interface for two different porous transport layers (PTLs) and catalyst layers at various loadings. We show that low porosity sintered PTLs exhibit higher interfacial contact with the catalyst and the membrane that results in improved kinetics. Radiography and modeling results indicate that oxygen taking multiple transport pathways through the PTL results in slug flow through the channels that reduces mass transport overpotential. Based on the results, we suggest design guidelines for high efficiency and durable PEMWE and their components.},

  abstract = {The limited annual mining capacity and high costs of platinum metal group catalysts (PMG) are confining the production of hydrogen from PEM electrolysis. Therefore, a significant reduction of catalyst needs is crucial to reduce system costs and increase production capacity. This study demonstrates the feasibility of a PEM water electrolysis cell design using porous transport electrodes (PTE) with catalyst coating by atomic layer deposition (ALD) and operation in 1~mol/L sulphuric acid at 60~\textdegree C. Though the catalyst loading has been reduced to 0.12~mg/cm2 iridium on the anode and 0.28~mg/cm2 platinum on the cathode, a current density of 168~mA/cm2 and mean high mass activity of 1400 A/g iridium could be achieved at 1.7~V. The characterization of three high loading PTE cells is combined with a detailed overpotential analysis from polarization curve fits and demonstrates a reproducible cell setup. Further analysis steps show an increasing cell performance with increasing coating cycle numbers and the consistency of the anode performance in the three electrode setup with the complete cell. The ALD coated PTE design turns out to be a promising candidate for catalyst loading reduction in PEM electrolysis.},

Realistic sintered titanium powder-based porous transport layers (PTLs) are generated via stochastic modelling, and we determine the influence of PTL-catalyst coated membrane (CCM) contact, pore and throat sizes, and porosity on two-phase transport. The PTL-CCM interfaces exhibit large open pore spaces, which are catastrophic for effective reactant transport due to the localized preferential accumulation of oxygen gas. As expected, increasing the sizes of the pores and throats results in higher oxygen gas saturations; however, we concurrently observe a surprisingly dominant mass transport effect whereby liquid water permeability is enhanced. The numerically generated PTLs are further tailored for enhanced mass transport by imposing a porosity gradient. By increasing the porosity from the PTL-CCM interface to the PTL-flow field interface, lower gas saturations and higher liquid water permeabilities are observed. With the opposite porosity gradient, the majority of pores adjacent to the high porosity CCM region become invaded with oxygen gas. We recommend a backing layer (microporous layer) at the CCM-PTL interface that improves the contact and permeation of product oxygen away from the CCM, thereby enhancing the performance of the PEM electrolyzer.},

A precise control of the PTL pore structure is achieved by incorporating poreformers of various sizes, and by varying the titanium and poreformer ratio. The structures are characterized with SEM and syn\- chrotron X-ray computed tomography imaging techniques. Comprehensive electrochemical performance analysis demonstrates that higher titanium loading provides improved contact at the catalyst-layer/PTL interface but suffers from severe mass-transport losses due to gas bubbles. We solve this mass-transport problem by mixing in large poreformer beads that produce a highly porous structure with excellent gas removal properties yet still maintaining mechanical integrity.

Randomly generated circle fibers are used to construct a patterned porous transport layer (PTL), and the volume of fluid (VOF) method is employed to capture accurate gas-liquid interfaces. The patterns of oxygen transport and the relationship between multiple transport paths are analyzed in detail. We propose for the first time the concept of `isolation belt', which is composed of a series of narrow throats, hindering the spontaneous combination of different oxygen transport paths. The influence of PTL perforation and spatially-graded fiber diameters on oxygen transport are explored. The numerical results show that perforation can probabilistically destroy the `isolation belt', forming a transport path with high priority, which helps to reduce oxygen saturation. Moreover, when the porosity of PTL remains unchanged, reducing the fiber diameter in the region near the catalyst layer (CL) can significantly reduce the local oxygen saturation. The pressure variation reveals its consistency with the maximum throat width of the oxygen transport path, which indicates the law of capillary pressure. From the perspective of mathematical probability theory, a novel functional expression of the profile of oxygen saturation with respect to the structural properties of PTL is proposed to make a concise explanation of gas bubble transport in the context of PEMEC or similar gas-liquid porous flow.},

They are, thus, a critical component for optimized performance, especially at high current density operation. This study examines the relationship between the microstructure and corresponding electrochemical performance of commonly used titanium sinter PTLs. Four PTLs, with mean pore diameter (MPD) ranging from 16~{$\mu$}m to 90~{$\mu$}m, were characterized ex-situ using scanning electron microscopy and X-ray computed micro-tomography to determine key structural properties. The performance of these PTLs was studied operando using polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Results showed that an increase in mean pore size of the PTLs correlates to an increase in the spread and multimodality of the pore size distribution and a reduction in homogeneity of porosity distribution. Electrochemical measurements reveal a strong correlation of mean pore size of the PTLs with performance. Smaller pore PTLs showed lower Ohmic resistance but higher mass transport resistance at high current density of 3.0~A~cm-2. A non-monotonic trend of mass transport resistance was observed for different PTLs, which suggests an optimal pore size beyond which the advantageous influence of macroporosity for mass transport is diminished. The results indicate that maximizing contact points between the PTL and the catalyst layer is the overriding factor in determining the overall performance. These results guide PTL design and fabrication of PEMWEs.},

  abstract = {The high potential for implementing demand management approaches across multiple objectives has been significantly enhanced. This study proposes a cooperative energy management strategy based on the end-user sharing of energy. The proposed method promotes the intelligent charging and discharging of EVs to achieve vehicle-to-anything (V2X) and anything-to-vehicle (X2V) operating modes for both integrated and nonrenewable residential applications. These sharing modes have already been discussed, but resolution approaches are applicable to a specific use case. Other application cases may require additional metrics to plan the fleet of electric vehicles. To avoid that problem, this study proposes the MIP method using a robust Gurobi optimiser based on a generic framework for cooperative power management (CPM). Moreover, the CPM ensures an overall target state of charge (SoC) at leaving time for all the vehicles without generating a rebound peak in total grid power, even without introducing photovoltaic power. Two different methods are proposed based on the flow direction of the EV power. The first method only includes the one-way power flow, while the second increases the two-way power flow between vehicles, operating in vehicle-to-vehicle or vehicle-to-loads modes. A thorough analysis of the findings of the proposed model was conducted to demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the charging and discharging schedule of several EVs, favouring a sharing economy concept, reducing peak power, and increasing user comfort.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive overview of comparative performance characteristics of proton exchange membrane (PEM) and solid oxide steam (SOS) electrolysers based on a thermodynamic analysis. The main factors which influence electrolyser energy and exergy efficiencies were temperature, summation of overpotentials, applied voltage, and to a lesser extent pressure. It is found that anodic overpotentials make up a majority of the total overpotentials in both electrolyser types studied and therefore further development of catalysts to reduce the overpotentials was recommended.  In the PEM electrolyser analyzed, the energy and exergy efficiencies are calculated and assumed to be identical due to the low thermal energy demand of a PEM because of low operating temperatures. It is calculated that an increase in pressure from 1.0~atm to 5.0~atm increased PEM electrolyser energy and exergy efficiency increased approximately 2.5\% over the range of applicable current densities. This is found to be because of anodic and cathodic concentration overpotentials going towards negative values with increasing pressures. This reduces the thermodynamic irreversibility and thus, increases the energy and exergy efficiencies. Given this trend, it is recommended that PEM be enhanced to operate at higher temperatures and pressures, while retaining thermal and mechanical stability. Hydrogen transport is found to be efficient in PEM operation, only accounting for less than 5\% of the overpotential distribution. Also, the assumption of neglecting concentration overpotentials for a PEM electrolyser is verified in this paper.  In the SOS electrolyser analyzed, the energy and exergy efficiencies vary with increasing pressure and current density. Both energy and exergy efficiencies are calculated and validated. The maximum energy efficiency is found to approximately 53\%, 53.5\%, and 54\% at pressures of 1.0~atm, 3.0~atm, and 5.0~atm, respectively, while operating at a current density of approximately 2000~A/m2. The maximum exergy efficiency is calculated to be approximately 60\% at a pressure of 1.0~atm, temperature of 873~K, and current density of 2100~A/m2. Also, at a temperature of 873~K, a current density of 2100~A/m2, and a pressure of 3.0~atm and 5.0~atm, the exergy efficiency is calculated to be approximately 62\%. Furthermore, electrolytes with higher ionic conductivity at lower temperatures are recommended to decrease ohmic overpotentials and increase the efficiency at lower temperatures.},

  abstract = {Gas diffusion layer (GDL) has a critical role in determining the performance of proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells and electrolysers by facilitating uninterrupted and smooth gas and water transport to and from the electrochemically active areas of these cells. The design of GDLs has been evolved significantly during recent years with the key aim of improving their performance for delivering their role. This paper provides a comprehensive review of modifications introduced to improve the GDL performance to date. The majority of these modifications have been carried out on fuel cells and the GDL in electrolysers has been studied to a lesser extent. The main focus of these modifications was found to be on water management and reactant delivery improvement as per defined for the role of GDLs. This review covers in detail the modifications linked to GDL hydrophobicity, GDL porosity, and engineered perforated GDLs. The effect of introducing a microporous layer (MPL) to the GDL is also reviewed by considering key design aspects such as MPL thickness, pore size, porosity, hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity, and the role of cracks in MPL structure. This review comes up with the key research gaps that are yet to be addressed and the recommendation for future researches to be followed for GDL modifications (i.e. to achieve further improved performance in PEM fuel cells and electrolysers).},

In particular, the effect of the presence of a very low quantity of electro-deposited cobalt on a porous Ni electrode directly interfaced with a commercial anionic membrane was evaluated. The modified Ni\textendash Co structure was investigated by XRD, SEM, EDS and XPS, and showed different characteristics compared to the starting Ni structure with a surface ratio of Co equal to Ni. The catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the electrode/membrane interface increased considerably compared to pure nickel and reached the same level as a Ni/Pt reference electrode. We believe that this methodology, if further optimized, could open a new way to find an effective improved doping of the nickel anode able to work with alkaline membrane electrolysers.},

Pore network modelling simulations are performed to correlate structural characteristics (porosity, mean pore diameter, and {$\beta$} pore volume fraction) to single and two-phase mass transport properties. Porosity and two-phase mass permeability are well correlated, but order of magnitude variations are observed due to inhomogeneous pore size distributions at the same porosity. The effect of varying ionomer and iridium oxide material mass fractions on ion and electron transport properties is also explored. Electrical conductivity is well correlated with catalyst volume fraction, while ionic conductivity is less correlated, likely due to changes in connectivity resulting from the inhomogeneous structure of the porous phase. Due to the non-homogeneity of the pore sizes in the catalyst layer, existing correlations for porous media are insufficient predictors. As such, we recommend that both porosity and mean pore diameter are considered when estimating transport properties. It is additionally recommended that both {$\alpha$} pore and {$\beta$} pore regions must be incorporated into catalyst layer designs to allow both enhanced connectivity and mass transport characteristics.},

  abstract = {Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), as a promising technology for hydrogen production from renewable energy sources, has great potential for industrial application. Gas bubbles are known to influence the PEMWE cell performance significantly, but a full picture of bubble behaviors and their impacts on cell performance has been lacking. In this review, we first discuss the most recent advances toward understanding the bubble evolution and transport processes as well as the mechanisms of how bubbles impact the PEMWE. Then the state-of-the-art bubble management methods to mitigate bubble-induced performance losses are summarized. Due to the similarity between PEMWE and anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE), we also extend related discussions for AEMWE. Lastly, we present principles of bubble management, followed by an outlook of scientific questions and suggestions for future research priorities.},

  abstract = {Thanks to a considerable number of fascinating properties, titanium (Ti) and Ti alloys play important roles in a variety of industrial sectors. However, Ti and Ti alloys could not satisfy all industrial requirements; the degradation of Ti and Ti alloys always commences on their surfaces in service, which declines the performances of Ti workpieces. Therefore, with aim to further improve their mechanical, corrosion and biological properties, surface modification is often required for Ti and Ti alloys. This article reviews the technologies and recent developments of surface-modification methods with respect to Ti and Ti alloys, including mechanical, physical, chemical, and biochemical technologies. Conventional methods have limited improvement in the properties and/or restriction on the geometry of workpieces. Therefore, many advanced surface-modification technologies have emerged in recent decades. New methods make Ti and Ti alloys have better performance and extended applications. With requirement of high surface properties in future. Understanding the mechanism in various surface-modification methods, combining the advantages of current technologies and developing new coating materials with high performance are required urgently. As such, incorporation of different surface-modification technologies with high-performance modified layers may be the mainstream of surface modifications for Ti and Ti alloys.},

  abstract = {Catalyst layer (CL) has a significant impact on the overall pore structure of the entire electrodes, thereby impacting the transport processes and the performance of polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells. In this study, the contribution of the CL to the entire electrode structure is experimentally investigated. The electrodes are prepared by using two types of catalysts with different platinum/carbon (Pt/C) ratios and Pt loadings and characterized by the method of standard porosimetry (MSP). The results show that for the same type of catalysts, as the Pt loading is increased, both the porosity and mean pore size of the electrode decrease, whereas the pore surface area increases. For a constant Pt loading, a lower Pt/C ratio results in a thicker electrode with a smaller porosity, smaller pore size, and larger pore surface area. The fractal dimension is found to be a good representative of the complexity of the pore structure of the electrode; a larger fractal dimension is detected for a higher Pt loading and a smaller Pt/C ratio.},
