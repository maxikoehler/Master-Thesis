  abstract = {This study investigates the impact of renewable energy penetration on system stability and validates the performance of the (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) PID-(reinforcement learning) RL control technique. Three scenarios were examined: no photovoltaic (PV), 25\% PV, and 50\% PV, to evaluate the impact of PV penetration on system stability. The results demonstrate that while the absence of renewable energy yields a more stable frequency response, a higher PV penetration (50\%) enhances stability in tie-line active power flow between interconnected systems. This shows that an increased PV penetration improves frequency balance and active power flow stability. Additionally, the study evaluates three control scenarios: no control input, PID-(Particle Swarm Optimization) PSO, and PID-RL, to validate the performance of the PID-RL control technique. The findings show that the EV system with PID-RL outperforms the other scenarios in terms of frequency response, tie-line active power response, and frequency difference response. The PID-RL controller significantly enhances the damping of the dominant oscillation mode and restores the stability within the first 4 s---after the disturbance in first second. This leads to an improved stability compared to the EV system with PID-PSO (within 21 s) and without any control input (oscillating more than 30 s). Overall, this research provides the improvement in terms of frequency response, tie-line active power response, and frequency difference response with high renewable energy penetration levels and the research validates the effectiveness of the PID-RL control technique in stabilizing the EV system. These findings can contribute to the development of strategies for integrating renewable energy sources and optimizing control systems, ensuring a more stable and sustainable power grid.},

  abstract = {Integrating offshore wind farms into existing power systems raises significant challenges, particularly in maintaining voltage  stability. In this context, conventional on-load tap-changers provide essential voltage control, limited to steady-state adjustments  due to their motor-driven response time. Therefore, this paper introduces a voltage control method that enhances on-load tapchangers by incorporating power electronic fast-switching modules. The proposed solution enables rapid and flexible transformer  tap ratio adjustment, significantly improving the voltage stability of offshore wind farms during high-voltage ride-through events  under strong and weak grid conditions. The FSM demonstrates enhanced performance in minimizing voltage deviations and  reducing the risk of disconnections of wind turbine generators related to overvoltages.},

The main objective is to facilitate fast prototyping of new wide area monitoring, control and protection applications for the future power system by enabling seamless integration with other tools available for Python in the open source community, e.g. for signal processing, artificial intelligence, communication protocols etc. The focus is thus transparency and expandability rather than computational efficiency and performance. The main purpose of this paper, besides presenting the code and some results, is to share interesting experiences with the power system community, and thus stimulate wider use and further development. Two interesting conclusions at the current stage of development are as follows: First, the simulation code is fast enough to emulate real-time simulation for small and medium-size grids with a time step of 5 ms, and allows for interactive feedback from the user during the simulation. Second, the simulation code can be uploaded to an online Python interpreter, edited, run and shared with anyone with a compatible internet browser. Based on this, we believe that the presented simulation code could be a valuable tool, both for researchers in early stages of prototyping real-time applications, and in the educational setting, for students developing intuition for concepts and phenomena through real-time interaction with a running power system model.},

  abstract = {The electrical power system represents a critical infrastructure our modern society heavily relies on. The network of dependencies that originate from it permeates almost all of the other infrastructure sectors that exist next to it, thereby justifying the fundamental importance of its integrity. The collapse of an electrical power system, known as a blackout, develops considerable negative effects on the economic and humanitarian constitution of a society affected by it, depending on the duration of its effect and its topological dimension. Ultimately, power system restoration reflects the only solution to that problem. However, this is a complex process, during which the system is in a state of significantly increased vulnerability compared to its normal operation. The knowledge base for the same process exists primarily in the form of system restoration plans and dedicated strategy concepts, which are not accessible to the public for good reason. This limited access to publicly available knowledge complicates the progress made within the framework of scientific discourse regarding this subject area. The development and use of a real-time capable, modular power system restoration simulator represent a methodical initiative to deepen the research work on this topic. Based on the scope of investigation that opens up in this way, the focus should be primarily on the development of application experience and increased transparency with regard to the strategic implementation of power system restoration processes. However, scientific history shows that, in addition to some answers, primarily new questions arise from a deeper insight into a situation. Against this background, four problem areas are to be addressed by four developed solution approaches. The first problem subject relates to the aspect of protection technology in the form of a macroscopic perspective. Since protection concepts are usually tailored to a reference operating scenario, which is usually the same as planned normal operation, an analysis of the protection system behavior in the face of power system restoration is essential. A protection security assessment system developed as part of this work is used to evaluate the functionality of the installed protection system during all stages of the restoration process based on simulations in a fully automated procedure. This opens up the possibility of a targeted elimination of identified problem areas.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a gradient descent based optimization method that relies on automatic differentiation for the computation of gradients. The method uses tools and techniques originally developed in the field of artificial neural networks and applies them to power system simulations. It can be used as a one-shot physics informed machine learning approach for the identification of uncertain power system simulation parameters. Additionally, it can optimize parameters with respect to a desired system behavior. The paper focuses on presenting the theoretical background and showing exemplary use-cases for both parameter identification and optimization using a single machine infinite busbar system. The results imply a generic applicability for a wide range of problems.},

  abstract = {As a result of the enduring change in power systems the risk of blackouts caused by voltage instability is growing. This paper addresses the challenges of future requirements and Var equipment. The focus is on enhancing the short-term dynamic performance of future electrical power systems. In contrast to traditional steady-state considerations, possible placement options of reactive power sources using dynamic stability indicators based on voltage trajectories are determined. After identifying worst-case fault scenarios based on the Contingency Severity Index (CSI), different time constants for the reactive power control of MSC and STATCOM and their effects on the short-term voltage stability are investigated. The preselection is used to reduce the computational effort and is based on indicators that are determined using RMS calculations. The approach is tested using a modified Nordic Test System with a 35\% share of renewable energy sources.},

  abstract = {There is a vast amount of literature dealing with voltage dips/sags related to power quality. The purpose of this survey, however, is to provide information on transient voltage dip/sag criteria following fault clearing related to power system stability. Information is included in this paper from utilities, reliability councils, relevant standards, and industry-related papers. One intention of this paper is to provide information for power system planning or operating groups of utilities, independent system operators (ISOs), or reliability councils seeking to establish such criteria. The material in this survey is based on published criteria from sources related to system performance, namely NERC (North American Electric Reliability Council), WECC (Western Electricity Coordinating Council), MAPP (Mid-Continent Area Power Pool), WPSC (Wisconsin Public Service Corporation), ONS (Electric System National Operator of Brazil), EdF (Electricite de France), China, TVA (Tennessee Valley Authority), and two sources related to equipment performance, namely ITIC (Information Technology Industry Council), and SEMI (Semiconductor Equipment and Materials Institute) F47. Three additional unpublished draft guidelines related to system performance from two North American utilities, (both in the northeast) and one southwest North American reliability council are also presented.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of joint optimal allocation and sizing of dynamic Var sources (ODynVarS) for short-term dynamic performance enhancement of power systems. A heuristic optimization based approach is proposed with the aim of achieving a desirable performance under multiple contingencies with respect to a reference short-term voltage response. Based on a pre-selected set of credible contingencies and potential candidate locations for device additions, the approach employs the mean-variance mapping optimization (MVMO) in combination with an integrated mixed-integer search strategy (IMIS) and two intervention schemes, to accelerate and guide the search process towards a techno-economically optimum solution. The first intervention is performed at fitness evaluation stage to screen economic solutions which entail technical feasibility and to reduce computational effort. IMIS and the second intervention is concerned with MVMO's knowledge management, which facilitates the search for solutions comprising a small number of devices with relatively large VAr capacity. The approach is tested using the IEEE 39-bus New England system.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a Fuzzy Logic Controller designed for an on-load tap changer within medium voltage distribution systems with bulk penetration of Distributed Energy Resources. As the on-load tap changer remains one of the most essential forms of voltage regulation in medium voltage distribution networks, improving its operation is a cost-effective response to the emerging voltage violations caused by intermittent generation during the early stages of the energy system transformation. Software-in-the-loop simulations were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared to the conventional methods. A modified CIGRE Medium Voltage Distribution Network Benchmark in European Configuration was modelled while the controller code developed in Python 3.12 was running on a PC, both coupled in a real-time closed-loop environment. The analyses showed that the proposed algorithm managed to reduce overvoltage from 7.02\% to 4.85\% in the benchmark network, thus demonstrating that the algorithm is efficient and ready for on-field implementation.},
