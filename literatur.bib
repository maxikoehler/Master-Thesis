  abstract = {This study investigates the impact of renewable energy penetration on system stability and validates the performance of the (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) PID-(reinforcement learning) RL control technique. Three scenarios were examined: no photovoltaic (PV), 25\% PV, and 50\% PV, to evaluate the impact of PV penetration on system stability. The results demonstrate that while the absence of renewable energy yields a more stable frequency response, a higher PV penetration (50\%) enhances stability in tie-line active power flow between interconnected systems. This shows that an increased PV penetration improves frequency balance and active power flow stability. Additionally, the study evaluates three control scenarios: no control input, PID-(Particle Swarm Optimization) PSO, and PID-RL, to validate the performance of the PID-RL control technique. The findings show that the EV system with PID-RL outperforms the other scenarios in terms of frequency response, tie-line active power response, and frequency difference response. The PID-RL controller significantly enhances the damping of the dominant oscillation mode and restores the stability within the first 4 s—after the disturbance in first second. This leads to an improved stability compared to the EV system with PID-PSO (within 21 s) and without any control input (oscillating more than 30 s). Overall, this research provides the improvement in terms of frequency response, tie-line active power response, and frequency difference response with high renewable energy penetration levels and the research validates the effectiveness of the PID-RL control technique in stabilizing the EV system. These findings can contribute to the development of strategies for integrating renewable energy sources and optimizing control systems, ensuring a more stable and sustainable power grid.},

  abstract = {Integrating offshore wind farms into existing power systems raises significant challenges, particularly in maintaining voltage  stability. In this context, conventional on-load tap-changers provide essential voltage control, limited to steady-state adjustments  due to their motor-driven response time. Therefore, this paper introduces a voltage control method that enhances on-load tapchangers by incorporating power electronic fast-switching modules. The proposed solution enables rapid and flexible transformer  tap ratio adjustment, significantly improving the voltage stability of offshore wind farms during high-voltage ride-through events  under strong and weak grid conditions. The FSM demonstrates enhanced performance in minimizing voltage deviations and  reducing the risk of disconnections of wind turbine generators related to overvoltages.},

Typical bifurcation control objectives include delaying the onset of an inherent bifurcation, stabilizing a bifurcated solution or branch, changing the parameter value of an existing bifurcation point, modifying the shape or type of a bifurcation chain, introducing a new bifurcation at a preferable parameter value, monitoring the multiplicity, amplitude, and/or frequency of some limit cycles emerging from bifurcation, optimizing the system performance near a bifurcation point, or a combination of some of these objectives. This article offers an overview of this emerging, challenging, stimulating, and yet promising field of research, putting the main subject of bifurcation control into perspective.},

  abstract = {An open source software package for performing dynamic RMS simulation of small to medium-sized power systems is presented, written entirely in the Python programming language. The main objective is to facilitate fast prototyping of new wide area monitoring, control and protection applications for the future power system by enabling seamless integration with other tools available for Python in the open source community, e.g. for signal processing, artificial intelligence, communication protocols etc. The focus is thus transparency and expandability rather than computational efficiency and performance. The main purpose of this paper, besides presenting the code and some results, is to share interesting experiences with the power system community, and thus stimulate wider use and further development. Two interesting conclusions at the current stage of development are as follows: First, the simulation code is fast enough to emulate real-time simulation for small and medium-size grids with a time step of 5 ms, and allows for interactive feedback from the user during the simulation. Second, the simulation code can be uploaded to an online Python interpreter, edited, run and shared with anyone with a compatible internet browser. Based on this, we believe that the presented simulation code could be a valuable tool, both for researchers in early stages of prototyping real-time applications, and in the educational setting, for students developing intuition for concepts and phenomena through real-time interaction with a running power system model.},

Additionally, it can optimize parameters with respect to a desired system behavior.

  abstract = {This paper introduces a Fuzzy Logic Controller designed for an on-load tap changer within medium voltage distribution systems with bulk penetration of Distributed Energy Resources. As the on-load tap changer remains one of the most essential forms of voltage regulation in medium voltage distribution networks, improving its operation is a cost-effective response to the emerging voltage violations caused by intermittent generation during the early stages of the energy system transformation. Software-in-the-loop simulations were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared to the conventional methods. A modified CIGRE Medium Voltage Distribution Network Benchmark in European Configuration was modelled while the controller code developed in Python 3.12 was running on a PC, both coupled in a real-time closed-loop environment. The analyses showed that the proposed algorithm managed to reduce overvoltage from 7.02\% to 4.85\% in the benchmark network, thus demonstrating that the algorithm is efficient and ready for on-field implementation.},
