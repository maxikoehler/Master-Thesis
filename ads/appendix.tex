\section{Voltage Stability Basics: Definitions}
\label{app:voltage-stability-definitions}

All of the follwong definitions are direct citations, and therefore the same wording as in the paper of \textcite{shoup_2004}. 
The definitions are short, precise and summarized resp. sythesized from papers and report from \ac{CIGRE}\footnote{french for International Council on Large Electric Systems} and \ac{IEEE}.

\textbf{Voltage dip:}
\begin{quote}\itshape
    \glqq A temporary reduction of the voltage at a point in the electrical system below a threshold. 
    If during a voltage dip the voltage falls below an interruption threshold, the event is sometimes considered to be both a dip and an interruption.\grqq
\end{quote}

\textbf{Voltage sag:}
\begin{quote}\itshape
    \glqq An rms variation with a magnitude between 10 \% and 90 \% of nominal and a short duration between 0.5 cycles and one minute.\grqq
\end{quote}

\textbf{Power system stability:}
\begin{quote}\itshape
    \glqq Power system stability is the ability of an electric power system, for a given initial operating condition, to regain a state of operating equilibrium after being subjected to a physical disturbance, with most system variables bounded so that practically the entire system remains intact.\grqq
\end{quote}

\textbf{Voltage stability:}
\begin{quote}\itshape
    \glqq Voltage stability refers to the ability of a power system to maintain steady voltages at all buses in the system after being subjected to a disturbance from a given initial operating condition. 
    It depends on the ability to maintain/restore equilibrium between load demand and load supply from the power system. 
    Instability that may result occurs in the form of a progressive fall or rise of voltages of some buses. 
    A possible outcome of voltage instability is a loss of load in an area, or tripping of transmission lines and other elements by their protective systems leading to cascading outages. 
    Loss of synchronism of some generators may result from these outages or from operation under field current limit.\grqq
\end{quote}

\textbf{Short-term voltage stability:}
\begin{quote}\itshape
    \glqq Short-term voltage stability involves dynamics of fast acting load components such as induction motors, electronically controlled loads and HVDC converters. 
    The study period of interest is in the order of several seconds, and analysis requires solutions of appropriate system differential equations; that is similar to analysis of rotor angle stability. 
    Dynamic modeling of loads is often essential. 
    In contrast to angle stability, short-circuits near loads are important. 
    The term transient voltage stability is deprecated.\grqq
\end{quote}

\section{Comparison of Trigonometric Functions}
\label{app:trogonometric-func-comp}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering

    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{plots/trigonometric_functions.pdf}
    \caption[Plot comparison of trigonometric functions]{Plot comparison of trigonometric functions}
    \label{fig:trigonometric-func}
\end{figure}

Trigonometric functions are used as relation between apparent power $S$, active $P$ and reactive power $Q$.
While in discription of dynamics, the planning of networks or connection of machines, often the cosinodal function and therefore its value is present in the feeling of (engineering) people.
In stability analysis often the $\tan$ function is used, simply because its directly connecting onle active and reactive power, and because some athematic reformulations are possible with that. 
\autoref{fig:trigonometric-func} is illustrating relations of these functional values to the angle in rad and degree, while \autoref{tab:trigonometric-func} gives a numerical connection.
This shall increase the feeling and evaluation of this thesis readers.

\section{Description of the Power System Simulation process}
\label{app:power-system-modeling}

In this appendix section, the general process of power system simulation is described. As this thesis is aiming to understand voltage stability and processes in longer periods of time, these explanations apply to pointer-based simulations, called RMS simulations. Meaning that the considered effects are slower electromechanical nature instead of faster electromagnetic ones. The in this thesis used Python framework \glqq \textit{diffpssi}\grqq~is based on this type of simulation, and due to its open-source based nature traceable.

\commenting{
    Really basic: (?)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item RMS vs EMT simulation (-> meaning one cannot simulate other faults than 3ph w/o ground)
        \item Phasor description
        \item Basic formulation: Static (algebraic) and dynamic (differential) equations
        \item Using of solvers (Integrators) for time domain simulation
        \item Using of different optimizatinon algorithms for steady state (load flow) simulation -> initial values
    \end{itemize}
    Less basic and more advanced:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item rountines in the framework
        \item two types: Algebraic and Differential equations have to be solved at each time step -> What is which? Which operational equipment is typically described with which type of equation?
        \item per unit system applying for easier simulation (different voltage levels)
        \item ...
    \end{itemize}

\section{Alternative Current Injection Model}
\label{app:current-injection-model}

\textcite{machowski_2020} describes another way of modeling a \acs{OLTC} transformer with variable ratio.
This model is looking at the shunt brnaches as current injections, which are added to the individual busses.
Beneficial, the system admittance matrix is staying symmetrical, while the different transformer state(s) are represented by the different current injections.
This can be mathematically expressed by following set of equations:
\begin{align}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \underline{I}_1 \\
        -\underline{I}_2
    \end{bmatrix} &=
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \underline{Y}_\mathrm{T} & -\underline{Y}_\mathrm{T} \\
        -\underline{Y}_\mathrm{T} & \underline{Y}_\mathrm{T}
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \underline{U}_1 \\
        \underline{U}_2
    \end{bmatrix} -
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \Delta \underline{I}_1 \\
        \Delta \underline{I}_2
    \end{bmatrix}\text{, where } \notag \\[12pt]
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \Delta \underline{I}_1 \\
        \Delta \underline{I}_2
    \end{bmatrix} &=
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \underline{0} & (\underline{\vartheta}-1)\underline{Y}_\mathrm{T} \\
        -(\underline{\vartheta}^*+1)\underline{Y}_\mathrm{T} & (\underline{\vartheta}^*\underline{\vartheta}+1)\underline{Y}_\mathrm{T}
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \underline{U}_1 \\
        \underline{U}_2
    \end{bmatrix} \text{ leading to } \notag \\[12pt]
    \underline{\mab{Y}}_\mathrm{\Pi,T,Current~Injection}&= 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \underline{Y}_\mathrm{T} & -\underline{Y}_\mathrm{T} \\
        -\underline{Y}_\mathrm{T} & \underline{Y}_\mathrm{T}
    \end{bmatrix} -
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \underline{0} & (\underline{\vartheta}-1)\underline{Y}_\mathrm{T} \\
        -(\underline{\vartheta}^*+1)\underline{Y}_\mathrm{T} & (\underline{\vartheta}^*\underline{\vartheta}+1)\underline{Y}_\mathrm{T}
